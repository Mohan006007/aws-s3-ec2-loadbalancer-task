AWS S3, EC2, and Load Balancer Setup
Overview
This project demonstrates a foundational setup on AWS, utilizing S3 for storage, EC2 instances for application hosting, and an Application Load Balancer for distributing traffic. The objective is to set up a secure S3 bucket, enable logging, launch EC2 instances with web server configurations, and configure a load balancer for traffic management.

Project Steps
1. S3 Bucket Configuration
Created an S3 bucket named myzen-bucket with public access blocked to ensure security.
Uploaded static HTML template files to host the web content.
Enabled server access logging to capture and monitor all access requests to the bucket.
2. EC2 Instances Setup
Launched two Ubuntu EC2 instances and installed Apache for serving web content.
Used user data scripts to automate web server installation, start the service, and deploy the HTML files on instance startup.
3. Application Load Balancer
Configured an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across the EC2 instances, enhancing availability and scalability.
Verified that traffic is routed through the load balancer’s DNS name to reach the application hosted on the EC2 instances.
Monitoring and Logs
Server access logs are generated and stored in the designated S3 bucket, providing detailed insights into bucket activity and access patterns.
How to Access
Access the deployed application using the load balancer's DNS name, which directs traffic evenly across the EC2 instances, ensuring a seamless user experience.
